# Insolvency-Risk-Analysis
## a) Specifying the question.
To cluster different factors that could lead to a company/ individual being

declared bankrupt or not, by determining their financial positions (stable,

potential and/or at risk)

## b) The Metric of success.
To identify the optimal number of clusters that best describes an organization’s financial risk status.

Accurate identification of factors that determine an organization’s financial risk status.

Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding involving a person or business that is unable to repay their outstanding debts. In Taiwan, insolvency denotes a state in which a debtor is unable to meet its debts when they are due, Link . The bankruptcy process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, which is most common, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common. All of the debtor's assets are measured and evaluated, and the assets may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt. Declaring bankruptcy offers an individual or business a chance to start afresh by forgiving debts that simply cannot be paid while giving creditors a chance to obtain some measure of repayment based on the individual's or business's assets available for liquidation. Upon the successful completion of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is relieved of the debt obligations that were incurred prior to filing for bankruptcy.
